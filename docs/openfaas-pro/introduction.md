## OpenFaaS Pro

OpenFaaS OSS is meant for developers, OpenFaaS Pro is meant for production.

## Additional capabilities

OpenFaaS Pro is a commercially licensed distribution of OpenFaaS with additional features and support. 

* [Trigger functions via Kafka](/openfaas-pro/kafka-events) for event-driven functions and to integrate with your existing systems
* [Trigger functions from AWS SQS](openfaas-pro/sqs-events) to integrate with events from AWS.
* [Scale idle functions to zero](/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero) to save on cost and increase efficiency
* [Retries for invocations](/openfaas-pro/retries) to handle failures, known problems with downstream APIs and concurrency-limited functions
* [Single Sign-On using OIDC](/openfaas-pro/sso) for enterprise-grade authentication and more secure credential management
* [Build functions via REST API](/openfaas-pro/builder) to create functions from source code, without defining and managing hundreds of independent CI jobs.

On our roadmap:

* A new UI dashboard for managing and monitoring OpenFaaS functions across namespaces
* Advanced concurrency limiting for functions for private or memory/CPU bound workloads
* Advanced authorization model for multi-tenancy and service providers
