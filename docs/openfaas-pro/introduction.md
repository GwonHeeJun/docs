## OpenFaaS Pro

OpenFaaS Pro is a commercial distribution of OpenFaaS for companies and enterprises.

## Included features

OpenFaaS Pro launched with the following features, with commercial support provided via email for customers.

* [Trigger functions via Kafka](/openfaas-pro/kafka-events) for event-driven functions and to integrate with your existing systems
* [Scale idle functions to zero](/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero) to save on cost and increase efficiency
* [Retries for invocations](/openfaas-pro/retries) to handle failures, known problems with downstream APIs and concurrency-limited functions
* [Single Sign-On using OIDC](/openfaas-pro/sso) for enterprise-grade authentication and more secure credential management
* [Build functions via REST API](/openfaas-pro/builder) to create functions from source code, without defining and managing hundreds of independent CI jobs.

On our roadmap:

* A new UI portal for managing and monitoring OpenFaaS functions across namespaces
* Advanced concurrency limiting for functions for private or memory/CPU bound workloads.
* Advanced authorization model for multi-tenancy and service providers
