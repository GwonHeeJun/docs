## Being successful with OpenFaaS

You shouldn't need to become an OpenFaaS expert overnight to find your way. Therefore we offer abundant free resources online, and commercial support for those of you who want to go faster and be certain of your approach.

* The docs and blog

    The OpenFaaS documentation has everything you need to get started and go to production. If you need more than this, you can [contact us about commercial support](https://openfaas.com/support/).

    Read the [blog](https://openfaas.com/blog) on a regular basis to keep up with news, features and to learn use-cases.

* Technical support

    Commercial users of OpenFaaS can contact the team to find out about support and other ways we can help you have success with the project.

    [Contact support](https://openfaas.com/support/)

* How we use GitHub

    The OpenFaaS GitHub repositories are only for tracking actual code changes. Issues can be created if they have reproducible instructions (a test case) and context. Who you are, what progress you're trying to achieve.

    GitHub is not for asking questions or for getting technical support.

Anyone is invited to contribute to the project in-line with the [contribution guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - you can also read the guide for ideas on how to get involved.

Key points:

* Propose your idea in an issue
* Always fill out the whole issue and PR template
* Give the context of why you need this and what company you're working for
* Don't start work on it until you receive approval from a maintainer

### Press-kit/media/swag

For stickers, swag, media or press-kit information head over to [openfaas/media](https://github.com/openfaas/media/blob/master/README.md)

Please use statistics across the whole GitHub organisation for numbers of contributors, GitHub stars, forks and other activity. OpenFaaS does not operate a mono-repo, so taking statistics just from the (faas) repository is misrepresentation.
